# Pioneer DDJ-SX2 MIDI Mapping for Mixxx

## Description 

based on hrudham's DDJ-SR mapping, with lots of modifications to make it work on the SX2.

use Mixxx v2.0 for this mapping.

## How do I use it?

if you just want to get your controller working with Mixxx without bothering about the details much, then do the following:

1. clone this repository, or download it as a zip.
2. copy `bin/PIONEER_DDJ-SX2.midi.xml` and `bin/PIONEER_DDJ-SX2-scripts.js` to `[Mixxx Directory]/controllers`. This will probably be one of the following locations:
    - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Mixxx\controllers`
    - Linux: `/usr/share/mixxx/controllers or /usr/local/share/mixxx/controllers`
    - OS X: `/Applications/Mixxx.app/Contents/Resources/controllers/`
3. make sure your Pioneer DDJ-SX2 is plugged in and turned on.
4. open (or restart) Mixxx, and enjoy using your (almost-fully-functional) controller

### Controller Setup

the DDJ-SX2 uses a sysex to go into serato mode, so we trick the controller into "this is Serato". no extra setup is involved. 

## What's implemented?

- crossfader
- deck
    - play/pause
    - volume
    - trim
    - equalizer
    - filter
    - cue
    - sync (needs a few fixes though)
    - needle search
    - headphone cue
    - grid adjust/slide/set
    - quantize
    - keylock
    - slip mode
    - tempo slider
    - loop functions (except slot select)
    - crossfader assign buttons
    - censor/reverse
    - pads:
        - hot cue
        - roll
        - slicer!
        - sampler (LEDs included)
        - cue loop (needs to be fixed though)
        - saved loop (uses hotcues as workaround)
        - slicer loop (maybe buggy)
        - velocity sampler
- jog wheels
    - scratching
    - pitch bend
    - skipping
- browser (except back button)
- load buttons
- panel select
- effects
    - since Mixxx uses a different effect framework, the effect panel wouldn't have worked properly, but i did it anyways
    - check out EFFECTS.md for instructions.
- crossfader curve (maybe buggy)
- sampler volume

## What's missing?

- parameter 1 and 2
- grid clear
- proper cue loop
- browser back button
- ch fader start
- tempo range
- sampler bank switching

## What's not possible at all?

- slicer with different precisions
- flip
- track number, song and artist buttons

## I found a bug.

awesome! go to the "Issues" section, and create an issue.

## I want to help.

you can fork this repository, clone it, install this mapping, and modify it using Mixxx and your favorite text editor (don't use Notepad though, it does not recognize LF line endings). then copy the changes back to cloned repo, and commit.

make a pull request when done.
